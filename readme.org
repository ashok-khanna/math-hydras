* Math Hydras

These are a set of keybindings for easy input of math symbols in Emacs. Hopefully when you look through the various keybindings you find them convenient and mnemonic. To use, just add the code in the file =math-hydras.el= to your =.emacs=. The default keybindings are =C-c m= and =C-c n=, but you can change this as you wish.

Star this repo if you like them :-)
