* Math Hydras

These are a set of keybindings for easy input of math symbols in Emacs. Hopefully when you look through the various keybindings you find them convenient and mnemonic :-)

To use, just add the code in the file =math-hydras.el= to your =.emacs=, or alternatively load the file directly in Emacs (e.g. via a =(load "/filepath/math-hydras.el")= command in your Emacs.

The default keybindings are =C-c m= and =C-c n=, but you can change this as you wish.

Star this repo if you like them :-)
